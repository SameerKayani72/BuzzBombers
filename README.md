# 🐝 Buzz Bombers - 2D Game Engine in C++ (Semester 1 Final Project)

🚀 **Buzz Bombers** is a feature-rich 2D game developed as my **Semester 1 Project**, built entirely in **C++** using **SFML**, without modern C++ conveniences. This project showcases deep understanding of low-level programming, game logic, and system-level architecture through creative problem-solving under strict academic constraints.

## 🎮 Game Overview

A fast-paced bee vs. bird battle in a dynamic ecosystem! Players navigate bees across 4 difficulty levels, build hives, collect power-ups, and survive against aggressive enemies. Each level introduces new mechanics, AI behaviors, and game objects.

---

## 🏗️ Core Features

- **4 Difficulty Levels** with progressive complexity
- **50+ Modular Functions** for engine components
- **Real-Time Physics Engine** for multi-entity collision
- **20+ Dynamic Game Entities** with custom behaviors

---

## ⚙️ Technical Highlights

- **File I/O** based High Score System with player name input
- **Custom Frame-based Animation Engine**
- **32x32 Grid Movement with Collision Prevention**
- **SFML Audio**: Sound effects + background music
- **Multi-threaded Timing** with SFML clocks
- **Cross-platform Compatible** and resource-managed

---

## 🤖 AI & Game Mechanics

- **Dual Bee AI** (worker vs. aggressive)
- **Hummingbird NPC** with respawn and HP system
- **Power-Up System** with timed/cancelable effects
- **Hive Construction Mechanics** based on collision logic
- **Dynamic Honeycomb Generation** with varying attributes

---

## 🚫 Development Constraints Overcome

- ❌ No STL Containers (used raw arrays)
- ❌ No Enums (used custom integer-based state handling)
- ❌ No OOP (pure procedural logic)
- ❌ No External Libraries (SFML only)

These restrictions pushed me to deeply understand memory management, function-based design, and algorithm optimization.

---

## 📈 Stats

- `4,784` Lines of C++ Code  
- `960x640` Resolution (32x32 grid)

## 🧠 What I Learned

✅ Systems-level thinking  
✅ Procedural game architecture  
✅ Complex AI logic without OOP  
✅ Game physics and collision from scratch  
✅ Creating scalable, maintainable code under constraints
