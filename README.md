# BuzzBombers
Buzz Bombers is a 2D game engine built in C++ with SFML, featuring multi-agent AI, timer-based power-ups, collision-driven hive mechanics, and real-time sprite animation. Developed under constraints (no STL, OOP, or enums), it uses raw arrays, state machines, and SFML clocks to manage 20+ dynamic entities across 4 levels.
